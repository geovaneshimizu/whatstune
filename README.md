# WhatsTune

Find out a music playlist according to the current temperature of a location, either by the city name, or by latitude 
and longitude coordinates.

## Business rules

* If temperature (Celsius) is above 30 degrees, the service suggests tracks for party
* In case temperature is between 15 and 30 degrees, it suggests pop music tracks
* If it's a bit chilly (between 10 and 14 degrees), it suggests rock music tracks
* Otherwise, if it's freezing outside, it suggests classical music tracks
